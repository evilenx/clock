## Description
**Clock** is a Rust project that provides a digital clock implementation with nanosecond precision.

## Features
- High-precision time display with nanoseconds
- Built in Rust for performance and reliability
- Simple command-line interface

## Requirements
- **Rust** (latest stable version recommended)
- **Cargo** (included with Rust)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evilenx/clock.git
   cd clock
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run the clock:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Configuration
The application requires a configuration file located at `~/.config/clock/config.yml` to set the font size.

**Create the configuration directory and file:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/clock
```

**Example `config.yml`:**
```yaml
font_size: 80
```

## Usage
After running the application, the digital clock will display the current time with nanosecond precision in your terminal. Make sure to create the configuration file before running the clock.
